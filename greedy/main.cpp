// what is greedy algorithm
/* In greedy algorithm a set of resources are recursively divided based
on the maximum, immediate availability of that resoruce at any given 
stage of execution */

// two stages:
/*1. Scanning the list of items
  2. Optimization
  */

 // requirements
 // 1. reqcursion
 // 2. context switching

 // Conditions
 /* 1. Each stepwise solution must structure a problem towards
 its best accepted solution.
 2. It is sufficient if the structuring of the problem can halt
 in a finite number of greedy steps.*/
